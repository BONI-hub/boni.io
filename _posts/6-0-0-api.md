The entry point of your application is `hello-boni/www/js/index.js` (where `hello-boni` is your project root folder). Find method called `onDeviceReady`. This is the method that will be called once your Hybrid mobile app is started.

The first thing you have to add is start ranging iBeacons. Then you have to implement your callback that will be fired once the app detects iBeacon. There are 3 available callbacks based on how far is the app from the iBeacon:

- onImmediateToSpot
- onNearToSpot
- onFarFromSpot

{% highlight js %}
onDeviceReady: function() {
  app.receivedEvent('deviceready');

  cordova.plugins.boniManager.ranging();

  cordova.plugins.boniManager.onImmediateToSpot(function(error, content) {
    console.log("I am immediate to spot!");
  });

  cordova.plugins.boniManager.onNearToSpot(function(error, content) {
    console.log("I am near to spot!");
  });

  cordova.plugins.boniManager.onFarFromSpot(function(error, content) {
    console.log("I am far from spot!");
  });
},
{% endhighlight %}
